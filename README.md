# Simple NFT Project

Using Hardhat to create a basic NFT project

## Overview

NFT ~ Non-Fungible Token

Non-fungible means that something is unique and canâ€™t be replaced.

Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are cryptographic assets which sit on a blockchain.

I used Solidity, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Hardhat to produce smart contract and deploy script that utilzes asynchonous Javascript.


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

### LearnWeb3DAO

This project was part of the LearnWeb3DAO course which gives users NFT's for completion of required tasks.  I would highly reccomend this track for someone who's learning the fundamentals of blockchain and Solidity which works with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and can be used to write smart contracts ~ Trustless verifiable agreements
